# TF-DCGAN

TensorFlow implementation of DCGAN[1]. The goal was to create an easy-to-read implementation
that could be modified easily. 

## Requirements  
1. `TensorFlow` (I used 1.3)
2. `NumPy`
3. `MatPlotLib`

## Running
Run `python main.py`

## Arguments
Check the FLAGS section of `main.py` or pass `--help` to `main.py` to see all the options.
